# Kerbal Automations in JS

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/victorperin/kerbal-automations-in-js.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This repo is a bunch of PoC exemples I have done to automate Kerbal Space Program, using krpc-node.

Some of this code was develop during live streams I've done in [my Twitch Channel](https://twich.tv/victor_perin).
